# Learning Blockchain Ethereum

This repository contains files made when completing [Blockchain, Ethereum and Solidity course](https://www.udemy.com/getting-started-with-ethereum-solidity-development/learn/v4/overview) @ Udemy

During the course I create Craigslist like page that uses Ethereum network and Smart Contracts to buy, sell articles.

* Smart Contracts are written in Solidity
* Frontend is complemented with web3 to support transactions
* Ganache used to develop
* tests written before deploying even to ganache
* Metamask used to add WEB 3.0 support to Chrome
